			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="indent">I have made an interest-free loan of £17,000 to Slough Labour Memorial Hall, a registered friendly society, from whom I rent my constituency office. The loan is to pay for refurbishing other parts of the premises and replacing a boiler. £14,500 has been repaid. (Registered 26 January 2012; updated 19 March 2013, 5 June 2013, 23 August 2013, 23 December 2013, 23 March 2016 and 13 October 2016)</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="indent">From 26 September 2016 to 31 July 2017, I have the support of an intern recruited through CARE, as part of their educational Leadership Programme, who works for me 4 days a week. The intern undertook training with CARE in September 2016 and received a bursary of £770 in that month. She is now paid through my staffing allowance and does not receive a bursary.
